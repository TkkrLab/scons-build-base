# scons build base

this repo contains a base for c/c++ projects using scons.

in the sconstruct file you can set the cc but probably gcc is fine even if you do

C or C++ it will choose rightly.

when you build with this script it creates a build director and in it a folder 

src that contains compiled sources, 

and also a executable that is your program.
